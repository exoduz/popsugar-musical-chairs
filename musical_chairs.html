			Take a second to imagine that you are in a room with 100 chairs arranged in a circle.
			These chairs are numbered sequentially from One to One Hundred.
			At some point in time, the person in chair #1 will be told to leave the room.
			The person in chair #2 will be skipped, and the person in chair #3 will be told to leave.
			Next to go is person in chair #6.
			In other words, 1 person will be skipped initially, and then 2, 3, 4.. and so on.
			This pattern of skipping will keep going around the circle until there is only one person remaining- The survivor!
			Note that each chair is removed when the person leaves the room.
